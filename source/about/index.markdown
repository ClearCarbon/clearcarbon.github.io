My name is Chris Hunt, I live in [Sheffield, UK](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Sheffield,+South+Yorkshire/@53.3957165,-1.4994561,12z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m2!3m1!1s0x48790aa9fae8be15:0x3e2827f5af06b078) with my wonderful wife and daughter. I'm a Software Engineer and Senior Developer at [epiGenesys](http://www.epigenesys.org.uk/).

I'm regularly found at a number of user groups around Sheffield including [First Play](http://www.eventbrite.co.uk/o/first-play-sheffield-1888152189), [Shrug](http://shrug.org/), [Sheffield.js](http://www.meetup.com/Sheffield-js/). I organise [Geeks in the Pub](http://www.gitpub.org.uk), a monthly meetup for all geeks, with [@richardathome](https://twitter.com/richardathome) and [@davidjmemmett](https://twitter.com/davidjmemmett).

A lot of my spare time is put into running an online gaming community called HoG. We organise regular [LAN Parties](http://hoglan.eu) which people attend from across the country and often from Europe.
